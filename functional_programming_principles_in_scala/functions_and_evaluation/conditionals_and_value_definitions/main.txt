conditional expressions
    - to express choosing between two alternatives, scala has a conditional expression "if/else"

boolean expressions
    - true/false
    - !
    - ||
    - &&
    - <=, >=, <, >, ==, !=

value definitions
    - we have seen that function parameters can be passed by "value" or be passed by "name"
    - the "def" form is "by-name" its right hand side is evaluated on each use
    - the "val" form is "by-value"
    - the right hand side of a "val" definition is "evaluated at the point of the definition itself"
    - afterwards, the name refers to the value
    - for instance, y above refers to 4, not square(2)
